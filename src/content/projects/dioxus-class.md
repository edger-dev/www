short: "Define constants and helper functions for tailwindcss and daisyui, do compile time checking for css classes"

---

Add compile time validation for tailwindcss and daisyui values. 

Learned about how to write macros to simplify the constant definition, also using proc_macro2 and some tricks to gather all the macro calls, and generate valid values for tailwindcss to run the build process.
