Hello, welcome to edger.dev

My name is YJ Park, I'm a full-stack software developer. I've been working on many different areas of software development, web apps and mobile apps, 2D and 3D mobile games. Have been using Rust, C#, F#, Python, Java, Elm, TypeScript, Delphi in previous works.

Instead of being an "export" of certain technologies, I'm more interested in learning new ones, it's amazing to see all these programming languages, development platform, frameworks, toolkits, free for us to learn and use, with open source codes.

It can also be frustrated with so many choices, e.g. to create a simple website like this one, I've tried a dozen of different approaches, spent many hours just for learning. Along the way, I've left a few unmaintained blog sites, with very few posts.

I'm trying to focus on more running codes in this site instead of blog posts, I will still try to write some posts, but main efforts will be put into projects (intended to be maintained longer term) or demos (for learning new technologies).
